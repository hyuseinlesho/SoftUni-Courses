            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an
            hour now. On her desck, lying between the copies of
            Nature, New Scientist, and all the other scientific
            journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
            copy of On the Road. It had been Molly's favourite
            book sinve college, and the longer she spent in these
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting
            under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do".
