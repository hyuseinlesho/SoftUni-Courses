# Spring Data - february 2024
In the course, students look in detail at working with a modern ORM technology: Hibernate, which is practically a standard for ORM in Java applications.
Hibernate enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) through "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API
for database queries and performing CRUD operations from Java.
Spring Data, on the other hand, builds on the standard API even further and provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process the data from the database.
The course demonstrate established practices in building the database layer of complex systems in Java applications through built-in implementations
of the Repository pattern and the use of the service layer (Service Layer), as well as import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).
