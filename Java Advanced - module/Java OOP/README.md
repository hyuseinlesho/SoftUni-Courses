# Java OOP - october 2023
The Java OOP course will teach students the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. It will go into the most commonly used design patterns. Attention will be paid to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
