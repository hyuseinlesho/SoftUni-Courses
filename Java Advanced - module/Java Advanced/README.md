# Java Advanced - september 2023
The "Java Advanced" course examines working with the Java language. In the course, students will learn to work with linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, as well as create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - Stream API for processing data streams. The development environment that will be used by the training team is IntelliJ Idea 2020, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.
